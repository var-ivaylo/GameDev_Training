1. **Implement the game Bulls and Cows in any programming language in order to grasp the main idea of the game.**

2. **Implement the game Bulls and Cows using SDL.**  

   **SDL Setup:**  
   Download SDL lib for Visual C++ from [here](http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) (tested with [2.0.3](http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.3-VC.zip)).  
   Download SDL\_image lib for Visual C++ from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) (tested with [2.0.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL2_image-devel-2.0.0-VC.zip)).  
   Download SDL\_ttf lib for Visual C++ from [here](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) (tested with [2.0.12](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.12-VC.zip)).  
   Extract the contents of the archives in a new folder named "dev_libs" in the solution directory and copy all the *.dll files from the "lib\x86" directory of each archive in the project directory.
